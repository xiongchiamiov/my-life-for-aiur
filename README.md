[War] is a classic children's card game where each player has a stack of cards.
A round is performed by flipping over the top card in each stack; the player who
plays the card with the highest number takes all cards played and adds them to
the bottom of their stack.

Ties trigger the titular war; all tied players place three cards face-down and a
fourth one face-up, and the placer of the highest card wins all cards in play.
If another tie occurs, another war is started. If a player does not have enough
cards to finish a war, they place their last card face-up.

There is no frontend yet; you have to play the game using a Javascript console,
like [Firebug].
