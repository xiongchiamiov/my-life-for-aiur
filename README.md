[War] is a classic children's card game where each player has a stack of cards.
A round is performed by flipping over the top card in each stack; the player who
plays the card with the highest number takes all cards played and adds them to
the bottom of their stack.

There is no frontend yet; you have to play the game using a Javascript console,
like [Firebug].
